Hello! This is a simple website that displays a random image of a cat every time you reload the page. Images sourced courtesy of https://thecatapi.com/, myself, and some of my friends. The website is very simple, and features a help message with all the (very few) keyboard shortcuts. Put any issues on the github: https://github.com/ltblem/cat_website/

Some planned features include:
- Automatically cropping/selecting images to the aspect ratio of the browser window
